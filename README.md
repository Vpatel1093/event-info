Coding Challenge

## Tasks

- Create a new rails application (you can use sqlite or postgresql as your database engine)
- Update the README inside with information on how to work with it if you think that some information might be helpful
- Set up an appropriate data model for the data in the csv files
- Create rake tasks to import the data in the csv files into the database (make sure to set the proper data associations)
- Create a simple controller/view to show the list of people who attended an event (selecting an event should display the people who attended)
- Create a simple REST API endpoint that returns a list of people as json. No authentication/authorization is needed here
